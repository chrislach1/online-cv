      I am studying Informatics at Ionian University.My university's base is an island of Greece which is called Corfu.I really like
      informatics and computer sience.The most exciting part of this sience is that we learn a lot of different programming languages
      and many other interesting things such as web security and databases.I think that this sience gives us the opportunity to expand 
      our horizons and make our lives easier.Aso computer sience has a really big range to work with.
